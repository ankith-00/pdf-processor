"""
Step 3 — Locate QR Cell: dynamically find the barcode target cell per page.

This is the critical module. The QR cell is NOT at a fixed coordinate — it
shifts vertically depending on how many exam centres a student has (and how
many course rows precede the exam-centre table).

Algorithm:
1. Get all drawn paths/rects on the page via page.get_drawings().
2. Find the text span containing "QR Code" (the column header).
3. From the header's x-position, determine the column's horizontal band.
4. Filter drawn rects to those in the QR column's horizontal band AND below
   the header row's y-position — these are the data cell(s).
5. If multiple rects match (split-cell case for 2+ exam centres), take the
   bounding union.
6. Return the cell rect (x0, y0, x1, y1) in PDF coordinates.

Validated against the real 320-page PDF: works for both single-centre pages
(QR cell at ~y996–1031) and multi-centre pages (QR cell starting at ~y977).
